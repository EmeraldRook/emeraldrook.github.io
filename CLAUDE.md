# Project Rules

## Pre-Commit Requirement

Before creating any git commit, always review and update `documentation/COMPANY_SITE_PLAN.md` to reflect the current state of the project. This includes changes to file structure, design tokens, section order, technical approach, or any other details covered in the plan.
